# Waste Classification Using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model for the classification of waste materials into categories such as metal and plastic. The primary goal is to create an efficient model for waste sorting applications using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Model Training:** Trains a YOLOv8 classification model on a custom dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Provides training and validation loss metrics and accuracy graphs.
- **Prediction:** Classifies images and displays results with confidence scores.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Waste-Classification-Using-Yolov8.git
   cd Waste-Classification-Using-Yolov8
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```


## Dataset

The model is trained on a custom dataset located in `Dataset_For_Waste_Classification`. Ensure your dataset follows the required format and is properly labeled.

## Training the Model
